Data Structures and Algorithms in Scala Programming Language

## Motivation
Motivation is self-learning.

Many data structures and algorithms will be ported from my competitive programming library.  
[xirc/cp-algorithm: Competitive Programming Library & Solutions](https://github.com/xirc/cp-algorithm)

This codebase is not intended for competitive programming.  
This is for learning how to implement data structures and algorithms in practical Scala programming.
